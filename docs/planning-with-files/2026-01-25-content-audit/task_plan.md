# Task Plan: Content Audit and Gap Analysis

## Goal
Audit the existing Python curriculum in `python/` for correctness, pedagogical quality (specifically the "Why-First" method), and completeness. Identify missing topics and areas for improvement.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery & Structure Analysis (Complete)
- [x] List all curriculum files to understand the current structure.
- [x] Read `python/CURRICULUM.md` and `python/CLAUDE.md` to understand the intended scope and style.
- [x] Map out the current sequence of lessons.

### Phase 2: Content Audit (Complete)
- [x] Review "Foundations" (01) for accuracy and "Why-First" approach.
- [x] Review "Data Structures" (02).
- [x] Review "External World" (03).
- [x] Check for code correctness and modern Python practices.

### Phase 3: Gap Analysis (Complete)
- [x] Compare current content against standard Python curricula.
- [x] Identify missing "intermediate" topics (Testing, Packaging).
- [x] Identify missing "practical" topics (Git, Debugging).

### Phase 4: Reporting (In Progress)
- [x] Summarize correctness issues (None found, high quality).
- [x] List improvement opportunities.
- [ ] Create a "Missing Topics" roadmap.

## Current Status
Audit complete. Findings documented. Ready to present to user.
