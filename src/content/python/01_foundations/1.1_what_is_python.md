# Lesson 1: What Is Python?

## The Problem

Computers don't speak English. They speak in electrical signals—on and off, 1 and 0. Writing instructions directly in binary would be like writing a novel using only Morse code. We need a translator.

Programming languages are that translator. But not all translators work the same way.

---

## The Metaphor

Imagine you're giving instructions to a foreign contractor to build a house.

**Option A (Compiled languages like C):** You write the entire blueprint in their language, then hand it over. They check the whole thing for errors first, then build. If there's a mistake on page 50, they find it before laying a single brick. Fast construction, but slow to get started.

**Option B (Interpreted languages like Python):** You have a real-time translator standing between you. You give one instruction, the translator tells the contractor, they do it. Next instruction. If there's an error, you won't know until you reach that instruction. Slower construction, but you can start immediately and adjust as you go.

Python is Option B—an **interpreted language**. Your code is translated line by line as it runs.

## The Technical Reality

When you run a Python program, here's what actually happens:

```
Your Code
       ↓
   Python Interpreter
       ↓
   Bytecode (intermediate form)
       ↓
   Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
       ↓
   Machine Instructions → CPU
```

1. **Your code** is plain text that humans can read
2. **The interpreter** reads your text and converts it to **bytecode** (a lower-level representation)
3. **The Python Virtual Machine** executes that bytecode
4. **The CPU** does the actual work

This is why Python is called "high-level"—you're far removed from the actual hardware. The tradeoff: convenience for speed. Python is slower than C, but much faster to write.

### Why This Matters for ML/Finance

In ML and finance, you'll often hear "Python is slow." This is true—but misleading. Libraries like NumPy and pandas are written in C under the hood. When you call `numpy.sum()`, Python hands off to blazing-fast C code. You get Python's ease of use with C's speed where it matters.

## The Code

Let's write your first Python program:

~~~python runnable
# This is a comment - Python ignores it
# Comments explain code to humans

print("Hello, World!")
~~~

Click **Run** to execute the code. What happened:
1. The interpreter read your code
2. It saw `print("Hello, World!")` and executed it
3. `print()` is a **function** that outputs text to your screen
4. `"Hello, World!"` is a **string** (text data)

Try editing the message and running it again!

## The Exercise

### Exercise 1.1: Hello, You
Modify the code to print your name instead.

~~~python exercise id="1.1"
# Print a greeting with your name below
print("Hello")
~~~

### Exercise 1.2: Calculator
Try these calculations—click Run to see the results:

~~~python exercise id="1.2"
# Try different operators - what does each one do?
print(10 + 5)   # Addition
print(10 - 5)   # Subtraction
print(10 * 5)   # Multiplication
print(10 / 5)   # Division
print(10 ** 2)  # What does ** do?
print(10 // 3)  # What does // do?
print(10 % 3)   # What does % do?
~~~

### Exercise 1.3: Multiple Lines
Print three separate lines of text. What happens if you use `print()` with nothing inside the parentheses?

~~~python exercise id="1.3"
# Print three separate lines of text
# Then try print() with nothing inside

~~~

## The Gotchas

### Gotcha 1: Indentation Matters
Unlike most languages, Python uses whitespace to define code blocks:

```python
# This will ERROR
if True:
print("Hello")  # IndentationError!

# This is correct
if True:
    print("Hello")  # 4 spaces of indentation
```

We'll cover this more in the control flow lesson, but know this now: **spaces matter in Python**.

### Gotcha 2: Case Sensitivity
Python is case-sensitive. `Print` is not the same as `print`:

```python
print("works")
Print("fails")  # NameError: name 'Print' is not defined
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. Python is an **interpreted language**—code runs line by line
2. This makes it slower than compiled languages, but faster to develop with
3. Whitespace (indentation) matters
4. Use `print()` to display output
5. Experiment freely—click Run to see what happens!
