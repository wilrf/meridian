# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

A **Python learning curriculum** focused on ML/AI/finance applications. Teaches Python from fundamentals through machine learning with emphasis on understanding *why* things work.

## Structure

```
01_foundations/          → Variables, types, control flow, loops
02_data_structures/      → Lists, dicts, functions, classes
03_external_world/       → Files, APIs, libraries
04_data_analysis/        → NumPy, pandas, visualization
05_machine_learning/     → Statistics, regression, scikit-learn
06_capstones/            → Full projects (Monte Carlo, sentiment, backtesting)
```

Lessons use `X.Y_name.md` naming. Projects are folders with `README.md` + starter code.

## Lesson Format (Why-First Method)

1. **The Problem** — What need does this solve?
2. **The Metaphor** — Layman's mental model
3. **The Technical Reality** — What's happening under the hood
4. **The Code** — Syntax and examples
5. **The Exercise** — Hands-on practice
6. **The Gotchas** — Common mistakes

## When Assisting

- Always explain *why*, not just syntax
- Use both layman metaphors AND technical explanations
- Include finance/ML examples where relevant
- For exercises: provide scaffolding, let learner implement
- New lessons must follow the 6-section structure above
